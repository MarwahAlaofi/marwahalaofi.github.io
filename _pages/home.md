## Welcome to my personal website! ![Saudi Coffee Pot and Cup](images/coffee-pot-64.png)


I am an academic at Taibah University, currently pursuing my PhD in User-centered Information Retrieval (IR) at RMIT University. I am privileged to be working towards my PhD with Professor [Mark Sanderson](http://marksanderson.org/), Professor [Falk Scholer](https://sites.google.com/view/fscholer/) at RMIT, and [Paul Thomas](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pathom/) from Microsoft. My research focuses on enhancing search engines to better serve diverse users beyond the use of search engine result pages (SERPs).
