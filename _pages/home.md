## Welcome to my personal website! ![Saudi Coffee Pot and Cup](images/coffee-pot-64.png)


I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Taibah University. I completed my PhD at RMIT University, where I worked with Professor [Mark Sanderson](http://marksanderson.org/), Professor [Falk Scholer](https://sites.google.com/view/fscholer/) at RMIT, and Dr [Paul Thomas](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pathom/) at Microsoft. My thesis explored ways to *realise the ideal test collection*: [https://doi.org/10.25439/rmt.30633188](https://doi.org/10.25439/rmt.30633188).

My research is in Information Retrieval, focusing on evaluation, user variability, and the role of LLMs in developing evaluation resources. I am particularly interested in advancing Arabic IR, including the creation of evaluation resources and the broader development of research in this area.
