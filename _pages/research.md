I have always been fascinated by web search engines and the human element they involve. I am interested in how individuals translate their information needs into different queries and how this influences the relevance and quality of the information they encounter. I examine the extent to which these often-neglected factors affect retrieval performance, with the goal of guiding the development of more realistic, user-centered methodologies and test collections.

## ðŸ“œ Minor Thesis
Inspired by the progress made in web search engines, my minor thesis investigated the potential of using personalization technology in educational library settings as part of [my minor thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gci7ke6ar8rwzc3/MarwahAlaofi-MinorThesis.pdf?dl=0) at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu). I proposed, developed and evaluated an approach that creates student models which capture their academic interests and respond to their queries with search results re-ranked according to their individual academic interests - I had fun working with users and got interesting results :)
