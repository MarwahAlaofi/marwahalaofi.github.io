I teach this course using Liang's textbook, "Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures" for students who have done an introductory programming course. The textbook is easy to read and understand for first year students, particularly those whose native language is not English. The textbook has many practical examples which progress as more advanced concepts are covered. The animations included in slides and made available online are great to enhance understanding — my students and I admire them!

## Lab Sheets
–they follow the same structure of the textbook_

They are designed in an interactive manner to help students observe, analyse and reflect and hopefully can serve as a set of activities to be enjoyed by students for extra practice. They are originally designed to be delivered in eleven weekly lab sessions. With slight modifications, these sheets can also be utilised as in-class activities thus I include them in both pdf and word files for your convenience. Any improvements to those sheets are welcome and in fact highly appreciated.
