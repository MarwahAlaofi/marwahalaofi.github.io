## Lab Sheets

These sheets are designed to help students observe, analyse and reflect and hopefully can serve as a set of activities to be enjoyed by students for extra practice. They are originally designed to be delivered in 6-7 weekly lab sessions followed by a few sessions allocated for students to work on an ASP.net project. Please note that these sheets are the 1st that I have written in my career in 2015 as a course instructor â€” though they have a special place in my heart they can be a bit outdated :)
