## Abstract
Where do queries – the words searchers type into a search box –
come from? The Information Retrieval community understands the
performance of queries and search engines extensively, and has
recently begun to examine the impact of query variation, showing that different queries for the same information need produce
different results. In an information environment where bad actors
try to nudge searchers toward misinformation, this is worrisome.
The source of query variation – searcher characteristics, contextual
or linguistic prompts, cognitive biases, or even the influence of
external parties – while studied in a piecemeal fashion by other research communities has not been studied by ours. In this paper we
draw on a variety of literatures (including information seeking, psychology, and misinformation), and report some small experiments
to describe what is known about where queries come from, and
demonstrate a clear literature gap around the source of query variations in IR. We chart a way forward for IR to research, document
and understand this important question, with a view to creating
search engines that provide more consistent, accurate and relevant
search results regardless of the searcher’s framing of the query.
